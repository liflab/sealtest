/**
 * Generates a test suite using a greedy algorithm. The algorithm works as
 * follows; given integers M and N:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Generate N traces, each having a length randomly picked between 1
 * and M</li>
 * <li>Pick the trace that maximizes the improvement on coverage according to
 * the specified metric</li>
 * <li>Repeat until compete coverage is reached and output the resulting
 * test suite</li>
 * </ol>
 * In case complete coverage is very hard to achieve using this algorithm,
 * a maximum number of iterations is also programmed (and usually set to a
 * high value), in order to prevent quasi-infinite loops. When this maximum
 * number of iterations is reached, the test suite is output even if
 * complete coverage is not obtained.
