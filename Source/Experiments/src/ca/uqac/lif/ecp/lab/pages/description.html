<p>This lab contains a set of experiments that compare a test sequence
generation library against data found in related works.</p>

<p>The lab is an instance of the
<a href="https://liflab.github.io/labmate">LabMate environment</a>, a
framework for producing self-contained sets of input data and experimental
scripts. For more information on how to use the environment, please
refer to the <a href="/help">help page</a>.</p>

<h2>Structure of the lab</h2>

<p>The lab consists of two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the first part, test sequences are generated from a set of
finite-state machines. Some of these FSMs are extracted from past
literature, while others are original to this work. You can
see the complete <a href="/data/fsm">list of all the FSMs</a> included
in the lab, along with the source files and pictures for each.</li>

<li>In the second part, test sequences are generated from a set of
Linear Temporal Logic formul&aelig;.</li>
</ol>
